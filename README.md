A modded version of [TorsionDrive](https://github.com/lpwgroup/torsiondrive/tree/master/torsiondrive) from [LPWGROUP](https://github.com/lpwgroup). Unfortunately, the development of the original library seems to be abandoned. I will implement here some useful new functionalities and happily merge them back in the original repository if needed!

Dihedral scanner with wavefront propagation. Please see the [Documentation](https://torsiondrive.readthedocs.io/) for more information.

#### Functionalities under development
 * Orca engine integration, at least with '--native-opt'
 * Make SPE calculation failures (e.g. SCF does not converge) non stopping
 * Native, embarassingly easy parallelization with the [jobdispatcher](https://github.com/mattiafelice-palermo/job-dispatcher) library

#### Funding Information

The development of this code has been supported in part by the following grants and awards:
